## Technical Notes

[Null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null)
: The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values.

[Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
: The Object constructor creates an object wrapper.

[Object.keys()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys)
: The Object.keys() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop.

[Split a String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
: The split() method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings, using a specified separator string to determine where to make each split.
